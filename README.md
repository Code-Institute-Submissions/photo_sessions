# UX
## Goals
### Visitor Goals
The central target audience for Photo Sessions are:
People who want to purchase prints for their house or business
Bloggers or web developers who want copyrighted photos for their sites or blogs (future development)
Business owners who want photos for their business, be those digital (next level fof teh site) or prints
 
 
### User goals are:
Purchase photos/prints
Navigate the site in an intuitive manner and complete the purchase
See what is available on the page and decide if any of the photos work for they need it for
 
 
 
A few of the possible goals users might have:
 
 
 
The design of this site fits the conventions of similar sites, and lays out the information in a user friendly and accessible way.
 
<!--The Photo Sessions page allows users to search by location, category, rating -->
 
### Business Goals
 
Business user goals are:
 
A well thought-out, well designed, user-friendly platform that will benefit my business.
 
A user interface that is user friendly for me to input my data easily and efficiently.
 
Value for money (at the moment the website is a student project, but eventual planning is to monetise this site, so it is worth adding this important goal here now.)
 
Photo Sessions is a great way to meet these user needs because:
 
The user interface for inputting activity data has been carefully controlled to validate input and make sure what is provided fits the needs of the database structure. Setting input field types to ------- etc makes sure the user is prompted when the data they provide is incorrect.
 
The edit photo page is clearly structured and laid out in a simple and easy to understand
 
 
The account page for the admin user shows all their existing products and gives them the option to view, edit or delete them from this location.
 
The users needs on each page have been thought about and buttons provided for these paths through the site, to make navigating easy.
 
### Photo Sessions Goals
Provide an effective, easy to use site for the users wishing to purchase prints
 
So that I can learn and practice frontend and backend programming together for the first time. To combine the use of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript with Python, Django....
 
While this is currently a student project, the idea is to transform this site into a site that sells prints of my personal photos and print of my friends' artwork (check Features to implement)

# Design Choices
The Photo Sessions website has an overall friendly feel. The following design choices were made with this in mind:
 
## Fonts
The primary font Lato was chosen for the main text of the site because it is easy to read and complements the fonts chosen for titles very well. An extra reason for picking this font is that it is still easy to read when printed small.
 
Social media icons for facebook, instagram and twitter are used in the footer of the site.
 
In the footer, to link to the social media outlets for Photo Sessions. these links do not yet exist, so currently the icons link to the main pages for each social media network.
 
On each photo page for any links provided by the organizers to their events and activities.
 
## Colours
### Photo Sessions Brand Colours
 
The brand colours for this project were chosen because they reference travel well, while still choosing tones and shades that worked well together without overwhelming the eyes.
 
A black was chosen for the main text as it contrasts with the white background clearly.
 
The navbar background colour is a clean white colour, light enough to provide contrast with the headings, while still setting itself apart from the photo background in the main content.
 
In the footer a white, provides the background colour, which is a good contrast to 
 
## Styling
 
All buttons on the site fit the same bootstrap button styling in size and shape.
Bootstrap cards were utilized on Photo Sessions to display short information about each photo, with a link to each photo page on it.
 
Css effects to all text links on the site (other than the Categories under the photos.cause them to animate to a darker shade when hovered over(other than the Categories)
# Wireframes
These wireframes were created using Balsamiq during the Scope Plane part of the design and planning process for this project.

# Features
## Existing Features

Footer
 
The navigation bar features the Photo Sessions logo in the top left corner.
 
For visitors to the site who are not logged in,they can view the products
All photos

For users who are logged in, the list items are as follows:
All photos

My account (this option is a dropdown menu)
Admin login
On top of everything what logged in users have, admin has the option of Product Management where itâ€™s possible to add the photo.
 
At every photo, admin has an option to 
Add new
Edit or Delete
 
Python determines if the user is logged in or not by checking if 'user' in session and passes this data to Jinja to display the correct navbar for the user.
 
The navbar is collapsed into a burger icon on small screens. 
 
The practical design choice was made not to fix the navbar to the top of the page as the user scrolls. This was because I wanted as much screen height as possible to display the website information on and I did not want to take up precious space with a fixed navbar. To get around the problem of having to scroll up a long way to reach the navigation, I added a scroll to top button above the footer as well.
 
Return to top button: 
 
A floating button appears on the lower right of the screen when the user starts to scroll downwards. Clicking this moves the view back up to the top of the page. I added this feature because some pages can be quite long and the navbar is not fixed to the top of the page.
 
## Footer
 
### The footer features:
Links to social media locations (Which will eventually be linked up to the Photo Sessions social media platforms, once they exist).
 
 
## Home Page
Photo Sessions homepage on all major screen sizes
Background Image: https://www.desktopbackground.org/wallpaper/high-resolution-beach-pictures-widescreen-hd-wallpapers-341566
 
The Photo Sessions homepage features a photo that is interesting to lovers of good photos and travel. I chose this image because it is eye catching and striking. The tagline for the website is laid over the image. This image was coded as a background-image in css and set to background-size: cover; so that it is responsive while never getting stretched or distorted.
 
Photo Cards
 
Each photo card on the Photos page gives the user some brief and useful information about each of the photos displayed. The photo image, price, rating and the category. Every card is clickable to go to the main photo page for that photo, so that if the user wishes to learn more the information it is only one click away.
 
Each card has three buttons next to it: Edit and Delete.
 
The edit button takes the user to the Edit photo Page where they can update the data for this photo in the database.
 
The delete button simply deletes the photo
 
 
Search
 
At the moment the filters available are:
 
By name (A-Z) and (z-A)
By price (low to high and high to low
By Rating
By Category (A-Z and Z-A)
 
 
 
As soon as the user clicks on one of these options a request is sent to pull the relevant data and display it for the user, without having to reload the page.
 
The user is also provided with a clear All Photos option under All Photos tab in the Photos page if they wish to return to looking at all the available photos.
 
On tablet and desktop size screens the filters navbar sits in a fixed position on the right side of the screen.
 
### photo Page
Photo Sessions photo page on all major screen sizes is responsive and ajusts to the screen size by rearranging the order of photos
Each photo page for an entry in the database displays that information in clearly laid out and easy to digest way. 
 
The image for the photo, in the photo page the dimensions of this image are not altered, so that the photo can have their entire picture on the website.
 
A category that the photo applies to is provided under the photo in the main photo page and when a specific photo is opened. I chose not to have the category in the photo page after the photo has been openend.
 
The photo description is displayed on the right of the photo in the photo page, for the user who has already scanned all the relevant data and wants to know more.
 
### Sign Up Page
The Sign Up page features a simple form, where the user can input an account name and password. The form was kept deliberately simple so that signup has minimum barriers.
 
 
If the user does not already exist in the database then the account is created, and a notification informing the user of successful creation of their account appears. 
 
### log In Page
The log in page also features a simple form where the user can enter their username and their password.
 
If the user inputs incorrect data a notification responds with various messages depending on what was incorrect.
 
When the user logs in with a correct username success notification appears 
When the admin logs in with a correct username success notification appears and admin can see Product Management in My account and will also have the option to edit or Delete photos
 
 
### Product Management Page
 
When logging in as Admin, Product management page appears. In there the Admin is able to add photos by inputting the name, SKU, description, photo searchable from the computer
 
### Account Page
Photo Sessions account page on all major screen sizes is responsive
 
 
 
### Add New photo Page
Photo Sessions add new photo page on all major screen sizes
The Add New Photo Page is where the admin provides the data for the Photo Sessions activities database.
 
The form is broken into sections, and laid out on a clean white background
 
The admin user is asked to enter the following data for their new photo:
 
Name
Category
price
rating
photo itself
friendly name
 
 
Categories - dropdown to indicate what categories the photo applies to.
Japan
Portugal
Philippines
architecture
beach
City
Nature 
Sailing
 
 
### Edit photo Page
The Edit photo Page is identical to the Add New Page, except that the heading on the page says "Edit" and data for the activity to be edited has been pulled from the database. 
 
 
### Admin account
 
Give myself (or any other administrator of Photo Sessions) special permissions to access / change data in the database from a Photo Sessions interface, rather than having to access the data directly in Django.
 
Give admin the ability to view, edit and delete any photo from database.
 
Have Order History on the users account page so they can see which of the photos have been purchased
 
## Features Left to Implement
Fix the option when a non-registered user buys the photo, to create the account for them
